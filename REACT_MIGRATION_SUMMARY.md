## 📝 Notes

1. **Backend Compatibility**: The React app uses the same API endpoints as the Next.js app. No backend changes needed.

2. **Environment Variables**: Uses `VITE_` prefix instead of `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. Update `.env` if needed.

3. **Image Optimization**: Next.js `<Image>` components were replaced with standard `<img>` tags. Consider adding lazy loading if needed.

4. **SEO**: React apps require different SEO strategies. Consider using React Helmet or similar for meta tags.

5. **Server-Side Rendering**: This is now a pure client-side app. If SSR is needed in the future, consider Next.js or frameworks like Remix.

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** - Go through all pages and features
2. **Update environment variables** - Set up `.env` file if needed
3. **Deploy** - Build and deploy to your hosting platform
4. **Monitor** - Watch for any issues in production

---

## 🆘 Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the terminal for error messages
2. Verify the backend API is running (http://localhost:8081)
3. Clear browser cache and localStorage
4. Check the browser console for errors
